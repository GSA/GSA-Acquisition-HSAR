      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p P">As prescribed in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3004.470–4(c), insert the following clause:
</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">3052.204–73 Notification and Credit Monitoring Requirements for Personally Identifiable Information Incidents (JUL 2023)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definitions.</em> Privacy Information includes both Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII). PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone, or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual; and SPII is a subset of PII that if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. To determine whether information is PII, the DHS will perform an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional information becomes available, in any medium or from any source, that would make it possible to identify an individual. Certain data elements are particularly sensitive and may alone present an increased risk of harm to the individual.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Examples of stand-alone PII that are particularly sensitive include: Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver's license or State identification numbers, Alien Registration Numbers (A-numbers), financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Multiple pieces of information may present an increased risk of harm to the individual when combined, posing an increased risk of harm to the individual. SPII may also consist of any grouping of information that contains an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits);
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Date of birth (month, day, and year);
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Citizenship or immigration status;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) Ethnic or religious affiliation;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(v) Sexual orientation;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vi) Criminal history;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vii) Medical information; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(viii) System authentication information, such as mother's birth name, account passwords, or personal identification numbers (PINs).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Other PII that may present an increased risk of harm to the individual depending on its context, such as a list of employees and their performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number. The context includes the purpose for which the PII was collected, maintained, and used. This assessment is critical because the same information in different contexts can reveal additional information about the impacted individual.
</p>
                                 <p class="p Runin List1">(b) <em class="ph i">PII and SPII Notification Requirements.</em>
