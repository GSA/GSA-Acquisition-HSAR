                                 <p class="p List2">(11) Privacy Information includes both Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII). PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone, or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual; and SPII is a subset of PII that if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. To determine whether information is PII, DHS will perform an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional information becomes available, in any medium or from any source, that would make it possible to identify an individual. Certain data elements are particularly sensitive and may alone present an increased risk of harm to the individual.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Examples of stand-alone PII that are particularly sensitive include: Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver's license or State identification numbers, Alien Registration Numbers (A-numbers), financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Multiple pieces of information may present an increased risk of harm to the individual when combined, posing an increased risk of harm to the individual. SPII may also consist of any grouping of information that contains an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(A) Truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits);
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(B) Date of birth (month, day, and year);
</p>

                                 <p class="p List1">(11) Privacy Information includes both Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII). PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone, or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual; and SPII is a subset of PII that if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. To determine whether information is PII, the DHS will perform an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional information becomes available, in any medium or from any source, that would make it possible to identify an individual. Certain data elements are particularly sensitive and may alone present an increased risk of harm to the individual.

Once the ATO has been granted by the Government, the Contracting Officer shall incorporate the ATO into the contract as a compliance document. Unless otherwise specified in the ATO letter, the ATO is valid for 3 years. An ATO is granted at the sole discretion of the Government and can be revoked at any time. Contractor receipt of an ATO does not create any contractual right of access or entitlement. The Government's grant of an ATO does not alleviate the Contractor's responsibility to ensure the information system controls are implemented and operating effectively.

The SA package consists of the following: Security Plan, Contingency Plan, Contingency Plan Test Results, Configuration Management Plan, Security Assessment Plan, Security Assessment Report, and Authorization to Operate Letter. Additional documents that may be required include a Plan(s) of Action and Milestones and Interconnection Security Agreement(s). The Contractor shall submit a signed copy of the SA package, validated by an independent third party, to the COR for review and approval by the Component or Headquarters CIO, or designee, at least 30 days prior to the date of operation of the information system.

The Contractor is required to update its SA package as part of the ATO renewal process for review and verification of security controls. Review and verification of security controls is independent of the system production date and may include onsite visits that involve physical or logical inspection of the Contractor environment to ensure controls are in place. The updated SA package shall be submitted for review and approval by the Component or Headquarters CIO, or designee, at least 90 days before the ATO expiration date. The Contractor shall update its SA package by one of the following methods:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Updating the SA package in the DHS Information Assurance Compliance System; or

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p P">As prescribed in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3004.470-4(c), insert the following clause:
</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">3052.204-73 Notification and Credit Monitoring Requirements for Personally Identifiable Information Incidents (JUL 2023)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definitions.</em> Privacy Information includes both Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII). PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone, or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual; and SPII is a subset of PII that if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. To determine whether information is PII, the DHS will perform an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional information becomes available, in any medium or from any source, that would make it possible to identify an individual. Certain data elements are particularly sensitive and may alone present an increased risk of harm to the individual.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Examples of stand-alone PII that are particularly sensitive include: Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver's license or State identification numbers, Alien Registration Numbers (A-numbers), financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Multiple pieces of information may present an increased risk of harm to the individual when combined, posing an increased risk of harm to the individual. SPII may also consist of any grouping of information that contains an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits);
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Date of birth (month, day, and year);
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Citizenship or immigration status;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) Ethnic or religious affiliation;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(v) Sexual orientation;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vi) Criminal history;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vii) Medical information; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(viii) System authentication information, such as mother's birth name, account passwords, or personal identification numbers (PINs).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Other PII that may present an increased risk of harm to the individual depending on its context, such as a list of employees and their performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number. The context includes the purpose for which the PII was collected, maintained, and used. This assessment is critical because the same information in different contexts can reveal additional information about the impacted individual.
</p>
                                 <p class="p Runin List1">(b) <em class="ph i">PII and SPII Notification Requirements.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			No later than 5 business days after being directed by the Contracting Officer, or as otherwise required by applicable law, the Contractor shall notify any individual whose PII or SPII was either under the control of the Contractor or resided in an information system under control of the Contractor at the time the incident occurred. The method and content of any notification by the Contractor shall be coordinated with, and subject to prior written approval by, the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall not proceed with notification unless directed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) All determinations by the Department related to notifications to affected individuals and/or Federal agencies and related services (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> credit monitoring) will be made in writing by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Subject to government analysis of the incident and direction to the Contractor regarding any resulting notification, the notification method may consist of letters to affected individuals sent by first-class mail, electronic means, or general public notice, as approved by the Government. Notification may require the Contractor's use of address verification and/or address location services. At a minimum, the notification shall include:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) A brief description of the incident;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) A description of the types of PII or SPII involved;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) A statement as to whether the PII or SPII was encrypted or protected by other means;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) Steps individuals may take to protect themselves;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(v) What the Contractor and/or the Government are doing to investigate the incident, mitigate the incident, and protect against any future incidents; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vi) Information identifying who individuals may contact for additional information.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Credit Monitoring Requirements.</em> The Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor to:

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Provide credit monitoring services to individuals whose PII or SPII was under the control of the Contractor or resided in the information system at the time of the incident for a period beginning the date of the incident and extending not less than 18 months from the date the individual is notified. Credit monitoring services shall be provided from a company with which the Contractor has no affiliation. At a minimum, credit monitoring services shall include:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Triple credit bureau monitoring;
</p>

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Establish a dedicated call center. Call center services shall include:

                                 <p class="p List2">(4) “Lead system integrator without system responsibility” means a prime contractor under a contract for the procurement of services, the primary purpose of which is to perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions (see section 7.503(d) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) with regard to the development or production of a major system.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) The phrase “substantial portion of the work,” as used in the definition of “lead system integrator with system responsibility,” may relate to the dollar value of the effort or to the criticality of the effort performed.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Limitations.</em> The Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor meets the definition of lead system integrator with [ ] without [ ] system responsibility. Unless an exception is granted, the Contractor shall not have any direct financial interest in the development or construction of any individual system or element of any system of systems while performing lead system integrator functions in the acquisition of a major system by the Department of Homeland Security under this contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Agreement.</em> The Contractor agrees that during performance of this contract it will not acquire any direct financial interest as described in paragraph (b) of this clause, or, if it does acquire or plan to acquire such interest, it will immediately notify the Contracting Officer. The Contractor further agrees to provide to the Contracting Officer all relevant information regarding the change in financial interests so that the Contracting Officer can determine whether an exception applies or whether the Contractor will be allowed to continue performance on this contract. If an organizational conflict of interest in the performance of this contract that is attributable to the Contractor's direct financial interest cannot be avoided, eliminated, or mitigated to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction, the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default or may take other remedial measures as appropriate in the Contracting Officer's sole discretion.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) Notwithstanding any other clause of this contract, if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor misrepresented its financial interests at the time of award or has violated the agreement in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Government may terminate this contract for default or may take other remedial measures as appropriate in the Contracting Officer's sole discretion.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) This clause implements the requirements of 6 U.S.C. 396, as added by Section 6405 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, And Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (Pub. L. 110-28).</p>

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) An individual owns, controls, or operates a business concern by fulfilling or holding the following types of roles or interests with respect to the business concern:

                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Director or officer, including incumbents of boards and offices that perform duties ordinarily performed by a chairman or member of a board of directors, a secretary, treasurer, president, a vice president, or other chief official of a business concern, including Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, or Chief contracting official.

                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Officials of comparable function and status to those described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this clause as exist in partnerships of all kind and other business organizations, including sole proprietorships.

However, specific facts of the case may warrant a different determination by Government in light of all of the facts and circumstances. Conversely, ownership, control, or the ability to operate the business concern, if it exists in fact, can be reflected by other roles or interests, and the offeror or contractor should reveal the existence of felony convictions if there is doubt as to whether the individual owns, controls or operates the business concern.

				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			A business concern owned, operated or controlled by an individual convicted of any felony may submit an award request to the Contracting Officer. The basis for such request shall be either that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5; that such individual no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or that commission of the serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business concern's integrity or business ethics and that an award would be consistent with the mission of FPS. The business concern shall bear the burden of proof for award requests.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) If the Contracting Officer in his or her sole discretion, is unable to affirmatively determine that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5 or that such individual no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern, then the Contracting Officer shall deny the award request.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The Head of the Contracting Activity has sole discretion to approve an award request.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) A copy of the award request with supporting documentation or a copy of a previously approved award request shall be attached with the bid or proposal.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) An award request shall contain the basis for the request (i.e., that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined by this regulation; that the convicted individual does not or no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or that the commission of a serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business concern's integrity or business ethics and that an award would be consistent with the mission of FPS). The award request shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Name and Date of Birth of Individual Convicted of a felony.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) Statute/Charge.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(v) Docket/Case Number.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vi) Court/Jurisdiction.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(vii) The nature and circumstances surrounding the conviction.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(viii) Protective measures taken by the individual or business concern to reduce or eliminate the risk of further misconduct.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ix) Whether the individual has made full restitution for the felony.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(x) Whether the individual has accepted responsibility for past misconduct resulting in the felony conviction.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(6) Upon the request of the Contracting Officer, and prior to contract award, in addition to information described in paragraph (d)(5) of this clause, the business concern must provide such other documentation as is requested by the Contracting Officer to use in determining and evaluating ownership, control, or operation; the nature of the felonies committed; and such other information as is needed to make a decision on whether award should be made to the offeror under the Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2008. The refusal to timely provide such documentation may serve as grounds to preclude contract award.

L. 110-356) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implementing regulations at Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171. This information is being collected to determine whether an individual that owns, controls, or operates the business concern submitting this offer has been convicted of a felony that would disqualify the offeror from receiving an award. This information will be used by and disclosed to DHS personnel and contractors or other agents who require this information to determine whether an award request should be approved or denied. Additionally, DHS may share this personal information with the U.S. Justice Department and other Federal and State agencies for collection, enforcement, investigatory, or litigation purposes, or as otherwise authorized. Submission of this information by the individual is voluntary, however, failure to provide it may result in denial of an award to the offeror. Individuals who wish to correct inaccurate information in or to remove their information from an offer that has been submitted should contact the business concern submitting the offer and request correction. Should individuals seek to correct inaccurate information or remove their information from an offer that has been submitted in response to a solicitation for FPS guard services prior to contract award, an authorized representative of the business concern submitting the offer must contact the contracting officer of record and request that the firm's offer be formally withdrawn or submit a correction to the award request. After contract award, it is recommended that an authorized representative of the business concern that submitted the inaccurate or erroneous information contact the contracting officer of record. The contracting officer will handle such requests on a case by case basis.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) The notification in this paragraph applies if this is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, blanket purchase agreement, or other contractual instrument that may result in the issuance of task orders, calls or option to extend the terms of a contract. The Contractor must immediately notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon any felony conviction of personnel who own, control or operate a business concern as defined in paragraph (c) of this clause at any time during the performance of this contract. Upon notification of a felony conviction the Contracting Officer will review and make a new determination of eligibility prior to the issuance of any task order, call or exercise of an option.</p>

Areas and routes used during the contract must be returned to their original condition by the Contractor. Airport management shall establish the maximum speed allowed at the airport. Vehicles shall be operated so as to be under safe control at all times, weather and traffic conditions considered. Vehicles must be equipped with head and taillights during the hours of darkness.</p>
