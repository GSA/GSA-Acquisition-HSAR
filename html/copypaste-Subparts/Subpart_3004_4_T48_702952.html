         <p class="p List1">(a) DHS requires that CUI be safeguarded when it resides on DHS-owned and operated information systems, DHS-owned and contractor-operated information systems, contractor-owned and/or operated information systems operating on behalf of the Department, and any situation where contractor and/or subcontractor employees may have access to CUI because of their relationship with DHS. There are several Department policies and procedures (accessible at <em class="ph i">https://www.dhs.gov/dhs-security-and-training-requirements-contractors</em>) that also address the safeguarding of CUI. Compliance with these policies and procedures, as amended, is required.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) DHS requires contractor employees that require recurring access to government facilities or access to CUI to complete such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the conduct of background investigations to determine fitness. Department policies and procedures that address contractor employee fitness are contained in Instruction Handbook Number 121-01-007, <em class="ph i">The Department of Homeland Security Personnel Suitability and Security Program.</em> Compliance with these policies and procedures, as amended, is required.

For acquisitions in which contractor and/or subcontractor employees will not have access to government information resources, but the department has determined contractor and/or subcontractor employee access to CUI or government facilities must be limited to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, the contracting officer shall insert the clause with its Alternate II. Neither the basic clause nor its alternates shall be used unless contractor and/or subcontractor employees will require recurring access to government facilities or access to CUI. Neither the basic clause nor its alternates should ordinarily be used in contracts with educational institutions.
